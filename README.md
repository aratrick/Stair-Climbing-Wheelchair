# Stair-Climbing-Wheelchair
We developed the prototype of a stair-climbing wheelchair mechanism which is based on front and rear wheel clusters connected to the base (chair) via powered linkages. The mechanism is optimized for wheelchair use and targeted at overcoming a number of shortcomings in currently available wheelchairs with regard to operation in barrier-present environments. It is a novel approach to provide assistance to the physically handicapped and aged people while climbing stairs.
